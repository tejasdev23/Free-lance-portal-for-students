    	"Description" : "Corporate Treasurers are rebelling against the traditional methods adopted to manage risk. Rather than using historic balance and transactional data from their bankers, they are looking to drive innovation as a result of new European regulations around account aggregators and payments.Large Corporate companies today typically have multiple bank accounts with different banks. Each of these accounts will be accessed via separate banking platforms; some are online, some are offline, and all require time and effort to access/analyse. Accounts are often in multiple currencies and across several geographies and require complex payment instruments to send and receive money. The new regulation will allow corporates to view all of their bank accounts on one platform, enabling treasurers to make sure their money is in the right place at the right time and in the right currency.",

This new regulation may increase competition, innovation and transparency across the European payments market. The impact will be felt in 2 areas in particular, presenting both opportunities and threats to financial institutions.Aggregators: The majority of people today have multiple bank accounts (i.e. bank with more than one bank). The new regulation will lead to the emergence of aggregators – providing consumers with a portal to view all of their bank details in one place. The aggregator will be able to build valuable insights on consumers offering a number of opportunities (e.g. being able to suggest products and services that most closely meet a consumer’s needs).Payments: When a consumer buys something online, the merchant has to go through intermediaries to receive money from the consumers bank account. The new regulation will bypass this process to allowing merchants to request the payment directly from the consumers bank account if the consumer has given permission. ",

    	"Description" : "With the rise of bots, virtual assistants and IoT devices, many believe that the app is evolving to almost extinction. In a world where 70% of the adult population has a smartphone, internet traffic is driven by mobile users and digital consumers interact almost exclusively through social media and messaging services, how will people consume banking services in the future?Organisations are realising the importance of the changing nature of customer behaviour – people are less and less willing to step out of their favourite channels to carry out transactions. For example, when web chatting with an airline company why do you have to revert to their website or app to make a payment? Or when talking to a client on social media, why can’t they view and pay their invoice there and then? ‘Zero UI’ allows users to do what they want, when they want, by allowing them to interact with the devices around them in more natural ways.Zero UI is an emerging trend which reflects a change in consumer behaviour. The majority of face time with apps is now spent using social media, instant messaging or watching videos. Virtual assistants are now embedded into every smartphone device (e.g. Siri, Google Now and Cortana) and over 10% of searches online are initialised through voice requests. Traditional digital platforms such as the retail service Alibaba and message service WeChat now process more payments than PayPal and other dedicated payment services combined.",
