    	"Description" : "Corporate Treasurers are rebelling against the traditional methods adopted to manage risk. Rather than using historic balance and transactional data from their bankers, they are looking to drive innovation as a result of new European regulations around account aggregators and payments.Large Corporate companies today typically have multiple bank accounts with different banks. Each of these accounts will be accessed via separate banking platforms; some are online, some are offline, and all require time and effort to access/analyse. Accounts are often in multiple currencies and across several geographies and require complex payment instruments to send and receive money. The new regulation will allow corporates to view all of their bank accounts on one platform, enabling treasurers to make sure their money is in the right place at the right time and in the right currency.",
